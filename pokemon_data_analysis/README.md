# Pokemon data analysis

This package provides an implementation of Pokemon data analysis, which is referred from [Michael Metter's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mmetter/pokemon-data-analysis-tutorial/notebook). 
I implemented this project by using Jupyter notebook, practicing my python skills, and basic data analysis. 
The motivation of this project is to understand the basic concept of data analysis including analyze the characteristics of the data set, search for the incomplete part of the data, add additional calculations to the dataset, and simply visualize our analysis for better understanding. Futhermore, I concluded the analysis with some machine learning techniques like linear regression and SVM as well as PCA. By using the pokemon dataset, the dynamics of the pokemon universe could drive an interest and become friendly with data analysis for students. 
I tried to follow the process of Micheal Metter's kernel, which includes a great job of data analysis with python. I also added some additional comments to each cells for detailed explanations of the code.
